# Random Walk with p5.js

## This was a test project to create a simple version of the Random Walk using the [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/).
## To define the random walk, we take two independent variables $$Z_1$$ and $Z_2$ where each variable is either 1 or -1, with 50% probability for either value. We set $S_0 = 0$ and $\displaystyle S_n = \sum_{j=1}^n Z_j$. The series $\{S_n\}$ is called the simple random walk on $\Z$.

### For more information on the random walk, please [see this page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk).

## To execute the random walk, just copy & paste the code from the sketch.js into the p5.js editor and run it.
